# 2D game with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and HTML Canvas !

# Making this project I learn:

- How to implement a very simple AI to make the creatures feel alive
- How to control the FPS of our game and how to measure time to trigger periodic
  events
- How to restart the game by pressing a button
- How to apply collision detection, resolve collisions and use that to simulate
  physics
- How to use the built-in drawImage method to draw randomised game environments
  and animated characters from a sprite sheet
- How to capture mouse position and animate an 8 directional sprite sheet based
  on the relative position between the mouse and the player character
- How to use HTML5, CSS3 and plain vanilla JavaScript to build a game from
  scratch.
